# NYC Branch Connectivity Intent
# Primary use case: Dual-homed WAN with SLA requirements
#
# This intent requests connectivity from HQ to the NYC Branch
# with specific latency, availability, and diversity requirements.

intent:
  name: "NYC Branch Connectivity"
  type: branch-wan

  # Endpoints
  source: IBN-HQ
  destination: IBN-Branch

  # SLA Requirements - these MUST be met
  requirements:
    latency_ms: 50           # Maximum acceptable latency
    availability: 99.9       # Target availability percentage
    bandwidth_mbps: 100      # Minimum guaranteed bandwidth
    diverse_paths: true      # Require paths through different failure domains
    encrypted: false         # Encryption not required for this connection

  # Solver Constraints - preferences that guide path selection
  constraints:
    avoid_nodes: []          # No nodes to avoid
    avoid_domains: []        # No domains to avoid
    prefer_domains:          # Prefer Domain A for primary path
      - A
    prefer_lowest_cost: true # Optimize for cost when SLA is met
    max_hops: 3              # Maximum 3 hops allowed
