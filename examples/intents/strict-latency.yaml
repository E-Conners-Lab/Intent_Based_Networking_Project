# Strict Latency Intent
# Use case: Low-latency application (voice, real-time)
#
# This intent has very strict latency requirements that
# may limit path options.

intent:
  name: "Voice Traffic Path"
  type: branch-wan

  source: IBN-HQ
  destination: IBN-Branch

  requirements:
    latency_ms: 25           # Very strict - 25ms max
    availability: 99.99      # Four nines
    bandwidth_mbps: 10       # Voice doesn't need much bandwidth
    diverse_paths: true      # Still want redundancy
    encrypted: true          # Voice traffic should be encrypted

  constraints:
    avoid_nodes: []
    avoid_domains: []
    prefer_domains:
      - A                    # Domain A has lower latency (10+12=22ms)
    prefer_lowest_cost: false # Latency matters more than cost
    max_hops: 2              # Minimize hops for latency
